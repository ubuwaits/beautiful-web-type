# [Beautiful Web Type](https://beautifulwebtype.com)

In October 2018 I released a completely re-thought and re-designed version of this project. The new version aims to provide a complete look at each typeface, cataloging all the available weights and styles, the full glyph set, the kerning quality, OpenType features, recommended pairings and more. I will highlight only typefaces that show a high level of quality.

## Suggesting Typefaces

I'm happy to receive suggestions for typefaces to feature either though [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/ubuwaits/beautiful-web-type/issues) or via [email](mailto:ubuwaits@gmail.com). When sending the suggestion please send an example or two of the type in use. This helps me to make an initial evaluation of the typeface.

## Old version of site

The old version of the site is archived here: https://beautifulwebtype.com/v1/

**Please note**: I no longer own the hellohappy.org domain. It was purchased by a link spammer who uploaded an archived version of the site with links to their essay writing services sprinkled throughout. Please spread the word by updating any links to point to https://beautifulwebtype.com rather than hellohappy.org.

## Local development

To work with the site locally, start the Jekyll server and watch the Sass files with:

    rake s
